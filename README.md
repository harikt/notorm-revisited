# Notorm

As the name suggest its not orm. I got an opportunity to get introduced by [Jakub Vr√°na](http://www.vrana.cz/) the author of [Notorm](http://www.notorm.com/) in 2010.

If you are new to Notorm, I suggest looking into the article [Database Interaction Made Easy with NotORM](http://www.sitepoint.com/database-interaction-made-easy-with-notorm/).
